# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful? 
The each method will be useful when trying to, on a large scale, modify each element in an array.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
The if statements mixed in with the arrays are something I am just going to have to be uncomfortable with. There are sooooo many rules and things we have learned that are all starting to merge together and It can be overwhelming.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment? Looking back on previous lessons really helped. I ahd about 14 different tabs open from different lessons. I LOVE being able to see the code do what I want it to do so I am always checking my output.
